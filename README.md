# Crypto Converter Documentation

## Overview

Crypto Converter is a web application designed to convert a given amount of cryptocurrency to the equivalent amount of a different cryptocurrency. The application leverages web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the CoinCap API for fetching real-time cryptocurrency exchange rates.
